## About

Re-Lux is a marketplace app where users can sell luxury goods, including designer clothing and high-end tech. It works in a similar way to apps like Vinted and Vestiaire Collective in that users can either make an offer on an item or add the item straight to their bag and proceed to checkout. The app also allows users to rate and review sellers, favourite items, and accept/reject offers on items they are selling. 

This was an ambitious joint project with my colleague Tony Rodriguez on the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp. It involved building a dynamic resale platform in React with a complex frontend architecture and multiple interconnected features. Overall, our approach worked well and we were able to deliver a fully functional app with no bugs. However, we faced a number of challenges during the build due to the complexity of the app.

### Brief


Our brief was to build a MongoDB/Express/React/Node.js application with full CRUD that met the following criteria: 

- Backend built with Express.js and Node.js
- MongoDB used as a database management system
- JWT token-based authentication to sign up, sign in, and sign out users
- Authorization implemented across frontend and backend to esnure guest users are not able to create, update, or delete data
- At least two data entities in addition to the User model (one must have a relationship with the User model)
- Full CRUD functionality
- Public APIs that require secret keys must be access from the backend only

## Installation

For the backend, clone this repository and install the following packages:
