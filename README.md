## About

Re-Lux is a marketplace app where users can sell luxury goods, including designer clothing and high-end tech. It works in a similar way to apps like Vinted and Vestiaire Collective in that users can either make an offer on an item or add the item straight to their bag and proceed to checkout. The app also allows users to rate and review sellers, favourite items, and accept/reject offers on items they are selling. 

This was an ambitious joint project with my colleague Tony Rodriguez on the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp. It involved building a dynamic resale platform in React with a complex frontend architecture and multiple interconnected features. Overall, our approach worked well and we were able to deliver a fully functional app with no bugs. However, we faced a number of challenges during the build due to the complexity of the app.
